Inspired by https://medium.com/@mvmurthy/full-stack-hello-world-voting-ethereum-dapp-tutorial-part-1-40d2d0d807c2

Ensure that you have your smart contract, web HTML and corresponding js in a worspace folder, ready before we begin.

Setup the dev environment, as shown , by npm installing ganache-cli and web3 into a local node_modules.
Run the ganache-cli in the first terminal

Open a secondary terminal , and trigger the node console by running the node command.
Initialize the required dependencies as in the guide with web3 and solc
Use solc to compile the smart contract code
Read about how the bytecode and interface from the compiled code are used further
Proceed to deploy the contract using syntax available in the guide

*****------ IMPORTANT: MUST-DO : NOTE DOWN THE deployedContract.address ; it will be required to access SC functions in our web application -----*****

Interact with the contract using the aforementioned node console. Refer to the guide to create a few votes

Open a third terminal session where we run the following commands: 
sudo npm install -g http-server
go to same directory of our dapp and run http-server
go to one of the addresses provided in the console output

Voila! You have your first DApp!
